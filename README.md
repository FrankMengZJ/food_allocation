# TTC Subway Delay Analysis

## Overview

In this project, I explored the TTC Subway Delay data, finding out the reasons why they delay and give suggestions on how to improve TTC Subway service
## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
